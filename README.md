# Kotlin - Bullseye Game

This is the app for the [Your First Kotlin Android App](https://www.raywenderlich.com/30498263-your-first-kotlin-android-app-an-app-from-scratch).

I've built a simple Game in a constraint layout that returns a random target number between 1 and 100 for the player to attempt to match using the seek bar. Once a player has clicked Check Shot the application will calculate relative position on the bar the clicked with the target number they shot for and return their score.

## Bullseye Game Breakdown!

Bullseye, like the title suggest, is a game of accuracy.  Placing the seek bar as close to the target number is your goal. Your score is calculated by the difference between the number you've placed the marker on and your target amount.

This is a simple and basic tutorial that allows a budding developer the opertunity to practice creating UI elements that a user can interact with and receive a response based on the user's input. It is great for learning or refreshing knowledge on project setup, project planning, layout xml, string xml, lateinit variables, gradle builds, imports, and so much more.
